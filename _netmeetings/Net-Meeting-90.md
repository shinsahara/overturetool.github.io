## Status of VDMTools Development

#### VDMTools maintenance
* Status is stable :-) 
* But, Dr.K seems to maintain VDMTools personally.


##  Status of the Overture Components

#### VDMJ

I've updated VDMJ to support the "pure operation" feature described by RM#27. This is only enabled in "vdm10" mode (not classic). I need people to test the feature before I try to make the corresponding changes to Overture. Note also that VDMJ has moved from SourceForge to GitHub (as SF was down for a couple of weeks!). See https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj.
